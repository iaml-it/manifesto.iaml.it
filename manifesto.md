# Manifesto

Is in the passion for knowledge, and the love for sharing, that the communities organize themselves and their activities.
The first and foremost goal is to share knowledge with others. Implicitly creating growth opportunities for the partecipants.



## unrolled ideas:
Intelligence is still undefined.
Curiosity is paramount.
Machine learning is the most promising way.
Collaborative is better then competitive.
Continous learning is.
